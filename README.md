bpi_ledset
==========

A utility to control the network (PHY-related) LEDs on Banana Pi
(original model, "BPi-M1"). This version has been updated to incorporate
changes that user _egamorena_ submitted on LeMaker's forum.

See:
http://forum.lemaker.org/thread-1057-1-1-switch_off_the_leds_.html,
http://linux-sunxi.org/Banana_Pi#LEDs


Compilation
-----------

compile with:
`gcc -o bpi_ledset bpi_ledset.c`

Alternatively, a simple Makefile is provided; so you may also just use

`make`

instead. The Makefile also supports cross-compilation,
given that you specify a proper toolchain prefix, e.g.

`make CROSS_COMPILE=armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi-`


Installation
------------

Copy the resulting `bpi_ledset` binary to a location of your choice,
preferably a directory included in your `$PATH`.

(When on the target system, you may use something like e.g.
`install bpi_ledset /usr/local/sbin`)


Usage
-----

Note: Due to permissions required, you will usually have to run `bpi_ledset` as root.
```
